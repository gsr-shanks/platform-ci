        <p>This job is triggered whenever there are new commits in dist-git
        repository for the <strong>'{component}'</strong> component. The
        repository is polled approximately once per ten minutes. If a branch is
        a {staging-branch-doc-link}, or if the branch contains a
        <strong>ci.yaml</strong> file, a worker job will be triggered. A worker
        job then issues a Brew scratch build from the code in the changed
        branch.</p>

        <p><strong>Triggers</strong>: A worker job for a given branch.<br>
        <strong>Triggered by</strong>: A change in dist-git (by polling).<br>
        <strong>Controlled by</strong>: {platform-ci-project-link}. Do not edit this job via web UI.</p>

      <p>This job is triggered by a {dispatcher-link} job whenever branch <strong>{git-branch}</strong>
